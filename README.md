Develop a multiplayer and online game. The game must have multiple clients running on different machines.

You may pick any genre (e.g., MMORPG, sports, card game, etc). If a game session has a limited number of players, like Chess, the game must have multiple rooms. If the game is an MMO, rooms are not needed.

The game also must have a chat feature. The player must be able to send private and broadcast messages, as well as group messages (i.e., sending messages to other players in the same room)
